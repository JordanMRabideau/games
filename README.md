# Game Backlog Manager

## Overview
The game backlog manager is a simple application that allows the user to see the games on their backlog.
The user is able to enter titles into the application, which will then populate a games database and be displayed on the screen. The user can then move games back and forth between 'not played' and 'played' columns, as well as delete entries from the backlog entirely.
